# Basic Exercises

I am Bhagat Sabari Nath. I am a high school student and my github profile conatins projects and exercises that I developed during my grade 11/12 Java course. These projects starts from using the basic understandings that I have built up over the initial few months of learning java, and slowly over time my exercises would get more advanced and logical as I further my knowledge of concepts and logic I learn over the course of my life.
