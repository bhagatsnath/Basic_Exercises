# Basic Exercises

I am Bhagat Sabari Nath. I am a high school student and my github profile conatins projects and exercises that I developed during my grade 11/12 Java course. These projects starts from using the basic understandings that I have built up over the initial few months of learning java, and slowly over time my exercises would get more advanced and logical as I further my knowledge of concepts and logic I learn over the course of my life.

Exercise 1: Dice Game

That Java program simulates a two-player dice game for a set number of rounds. In each round, players roll two dice, and points are scored for getting a pair (4 points) or consecutive numbers (2 points). The program keeps track of the total points for each player and then declares the winner at the end.
