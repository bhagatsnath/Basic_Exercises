# Basic Exercises

I am Bhagat Sabari Nath. I am a high school student and my github profile conatins projects and exercises that I developed during my grade 11/12 Java course. These projects starts from using the basic understandings that I have built up over the initial few months of learning java, and slowly over time my exercises would get more advanced and logical as I further my knowledge of concepts and logic I learn over the course of my life.

Exercise 1: Dice Game

This Java program simulates a two-player dice game for a set number of rounds. In each round, players roll two dice, and points are scored for getting a pair (4 points) or consecutive numbers (2 points). The program keeps track of the total points for each player and then declares the winner at the end.

Exercise 2: Largest Number with Fewest Factor Calculator

This java program uses loops and the Set Class to find the largest number less than 1000, that has the least number of factors. It iterates backward from 999, calculating the total number of factors (divisors) for each integer. The program maintains a record of the largest number found so far that is composite (has 3 or more factors) and possesses the smallest factor count. The final output is the specific number that satisfies both the "largest" and "least number of factors" criteria within the range.
